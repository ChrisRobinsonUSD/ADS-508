In an attempt to ensure fair and equitable access to postsecondary educational opportunities, the Office of Postsecondary Education is exploring new and creative ways to identify communities in need of greater outreach regarding available funding for postsecondary education.  Our company was selected by the Department of Educationâ€™s Office of Postsecondary Education to help fill in the gaps in educational attainment data across the United States to facilitate effective outreach to the communities which need it most.  

To minimize cost, time, and resources, a pilot program has been established to explore the use of machine learning technologies to predict areas where postsecondary education opportunities would have the largest impact.  The pilot program will use demographic data from the state of California to create a predictive model to identify areas of potential low postsecondary educational attainment.  California was chosen as the pilot state as it has very reliable census data and is a very socioeconomically diverse state.

Available 2020 Census data was pre-processed for use in AWS Sagemaker where an XGBoost model was trained utilizing 33 independent variables to predict whether each block group was above or below average California post-secondary educational attainment.  Initial model results have been positive with desirable scores in key metrics such as accuracy, f-1 score, precision, and recall.

Problem Statement:
Many people feel that education beyond high school is unattainable due to economic and social factors.  Educational outreach is vital as individuals are often unaware of opportunities available to them for free, or low cost, postsecondary education.  Unfortunately, data pertaining to postsecondary education is not reliably available in some parts of the country, especially in areas which struggle to get census participation.  These gaps make effective outreach very difficult.  This project aims to fill in gaps in educational attainment data in order to facilitate more effective outreach to communities most in need of the opportunities available.

Goals:
The primary goal of this project is to create a model which can be used to predict areas of low postsecondary educational attainment for the purposes of community outreach.  A secondary goal is to potentially identify underserved communities as it relates to postsecondary education. 
Non-Goals:
This project is not attempting to quantify individuals in any community, nor is it the goal to identify root causes of potential inequality in the community.
